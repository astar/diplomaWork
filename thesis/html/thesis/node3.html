[lines = 3, loversize=-0.1, lraise=0.1]From the dawn of existence astronomy has always been starved for
data, but in the last few decades the situation has changed and now we
are facing the data flood of biblical proportions. The data are not
just increasing in size but in complexity and
dimensionality. [<A
 HREF="node23.html#ballastroinformatics">Ball and Schade(2010)</A>] Astroinformatics is the
new field of science which has emerged from this technology driven
progress.  Virtual Observatory, Machine learning, Data Mining, Grid
computing are just few examples of new tools available to
scientist.

Of course astronomers are not alone and particle physics, biology and
other sciences are also in the vanguard of the data intensive
science. This is great opportunity for interdisciplinary
collaboration. 

<P>
This work deals with the problem of semi-automatic procedures for
finding Be stars candidates in the astronomy surveys. More than
straight forward process it's trail and error approach probing new
possibilities with rather interesting that useful results.

<P>
The aim of this work is to be introductory to the technologies of
Virtual Observatory and Data Mining and for this reason it is intended
to have following properties:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Main Chapters starts with questions answered in the text and
  diagram to ease orietation,
</LI>
<LI>is full of examples, 
</LI>
<LI>is non-linear in nature,
</LI>
<LI>is meant to be compact and consistent,
</LI>
<LI>is far from complete.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Chapter one is an introduction to the technologies related to Virtual
Observatory. The motivation behind the concept is given without paying
too much attention to historical details. Main standards and protocols
are discussed and explained. Important aspect are demonstrated on
numerous examples. Chapter two is an introduction to Machine Learning
and Data Mining in the context of astrophysics. Only methods used in
practical part of this work are described in detail: Decision Trees
and Support Vector Machines. Examples of several classifications are
demonstrated. Third chapter introduces problematic of Be
stars. Chapter Four is practical application of previously described
technologies and methods. Training data of confirmed Be stars from
Ondrejov are correlated with others catalogues to obtain color indexes
and spectra. Results are processed by Data Mining algorithms using
several libraries and tools. In the last chapter achieved results are
critically discussed.

<P>
Activities related to this work go beyond this text. Wiki pages were
created to present the results and discuss related topic with
supervisor as well as with others scientist around the world. Several
programs were created to analyze and process acquired data. Source
codes were maintained by GIT version system allowing easy sharing. All
software used and produced are open source.
