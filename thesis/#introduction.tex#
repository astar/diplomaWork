\lettrine[lines = 3, loversize=-0.1, lraise=0.1]{F}{}rom the dawn of
its existence astronomy has been starving for data but in the last few
decades the situation has changed and now we are facing data deluge of
biblical proportions. The data are not just increasing in size but
also in complexity and dimensionality
\citep{ballastroinformatics}. Astroinformatics is the new field of
science which has emerged from this technology driven progress.
Virtual Observatory, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Grid Computing are
just few examples of new tools available to scientists.

The astronomers are not alone and particle physics, biology and other
sciences are also in the vanguard of the data intensive science. This
is great opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration.

This work deals with the problem of semi-automatic procedures for
finding Be stars \citep{porter2003classical} candidates in the
astronomical surveys. More than straightforward process it is trial and
error approach probing new possibilities.

The aim of this work is to be the introduction to the technologies of
Virtual Observatory and massive data processing in general.

%  and for this reason it is intended
% to have following properties:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Main Chapters starts with diagram to ease orietation,
% \item is full of examples, 
% \item is non-linear in nature,
% \item is meant to be compact and consistent,
% \item is far from complete.
% \end{itemize}

The chapter one is an introduction to the technologies related to
Virtual Observatory. The motivation behind the concept is given
without paying too much attention to historical details. Main
principles and protocols are discussed and explained. Important aspect
are demonstrated on numerous examples. The chapter two is an
introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining in the context of
astrophysics. Only methods used in practical part of this work are
described in detail: Decision Trees and Support Vector
Machines. Examples of several classifications are demonstrated. The
third chapter introduces issues of Be stars. The chapter Four is
practical application of previously described technologies and
methods. Training data of confirmed Be stars from Ond\v{r}ejov are
cross-matched with other catalogues to obtain color indexes and
spectra. Results are processed by data mining algorithms using several
libraries and tools. In the last chapter, achieved results are
critically discussed.

Many scripts were written to achieve individual goals. In the text,
there are numerous commented snippets of codes. Their purpose is to
demonstrate the concept, that is why they are short and without
auxiliary technicalities such as error handling etc. They are mostly
Python and shell scripts. Any interested person can obtain the full
source codes (including thesis itself) from GIT repository
\footnote{\url{git://github.com/astar/diplomaWork}}.

\noindent Activities related to this work went beyond this text. Wiki
pages\footnote{\url{http://physics.muni.cz/~vazny/wiki/index.php/Diploma_work}}
were created to present the results and discuss related topic with
supervisor as well as with other scientist around the world. Source
codes were maintained by GIT version system allowing easy sharing. All
software used and produced is open source.
