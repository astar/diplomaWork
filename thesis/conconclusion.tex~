The harvesting of large-scale astronomical data is challenging but
solvable problem. The technology of Virtual Observatory offers solid
background for data discovery and retrieval. The whole process can be
automated using UN*X like approach of small and single purpose scripts
or programs. The last stage of choosing the right characteristics and
Data Mining method is even more complex task requiring deep
understanding of the researched phenomenas and Machine Learning theory
and technology. The possible solution can be based on cooperation
between experts in scientific and computer science field. Without such
collaboration we are missing lots of opportunities.
