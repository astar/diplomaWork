\chapter{ Virtual Observatory (VO)}

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
What is the motivation behind Virtual Observatory? Is data avalanche
problem only in astronomy? What is IVOA?  What is Virtual Observatory
architecture, standards and protocols
\end{lstlisting}

\section{ Data avalanche: Opportunity or disaster?}

There are two important trends in current astronomy surveys:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{Size:} The cumulative compressed data holdings of the ESO archive will
    reach 1 PetaByte by 2012 \cite{hanisch2010international}. Projects
    like Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will produce about 30
    TB per night, leading to a total database over the ten years of
    operations of 60 PB for the raw data.
   
  \item{Diversity:}  Modern surveys will cover the sky in different wavebands, from
    gamma- and X-rays, optical, infrared, through to radio. The ability
    to crossmatch these observations toghether may lead to the new
    understanding of physical phenomenas.
\end{itemize}

    Such amount of data is not possible transfer over the network. It
    imply they are heterogenous and distributed in nature.


    There is an interesting analogy with the problem (and the
    solution) which had scientist during LEP project at CERN.  Their
    problem was too many documents in different formats. Tim
    Berners-Lee \footnote{ Sir Timothy John "Tim" Berners-Lee. British
      engineer and computer scientist and MIT professor credited with
      inventing the World Wide Web.} designed set of protocols (URIs,
    HTTP and HTML) which allowed link and share documents
    \cite{berners1990worldwideweb}. This was recognized as generaly
    useful and World Wide Web was born. An important role plays the
    World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in developing Web
    standards. \footnote{Prior to its creation, incompatible versions
      of HTML were offered by different vendors, increasing the
      potential for inconsistency between web pages.}
    

    
    Particle physics, neuroscience, medical science, computer science
    and many others are facing the same problem. This is an
    opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration.

\section{International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA)}

    What is neccessary is sets of standards and protocols to deal with
    heterogenous distributed data and the authority which encourages
    their implementation. Such authority is the International Virtual
    Observatory Alliance (IVOA). It comprises 19 VO programs from
    Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe,
    France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, the
    United Kingdom, and the United States and inter-governmental
    organizations (ESA and ESO)\cite{hanisch2010international}.

\section{Architecture}
    The Virtual Observatory is the  “middle layer” framework
    which connects the Resource Layer to the User Layer in a seamless
    and transparent manner. The objective is to improve and unify access to
    astronomical data and services.

\section{VOResources}

A resource is a general term referring to a VO element that can be
described in terms of who curates or maintains it and which can be
given a name and a unique identifier. Just about anything can be a
resource: it can be an abstract idea, such as sky coverage or an
                                                                   4
instrumental setup, or it can be fairly concrete, like an organization
or a data collection. \cite{bensonivoa}

\section{VOregistry}
    Is the standard defined by IVOA for registration of VO-Resources

    The IVOA Registry enables users and applications in the User Layer to discover 
    data  and  metadata  collections,  as  well  services  in  the  Resource  Layer.  A 
    resource  is  a  general  term  referring  to  a  VO  element  that  can  be  described  in 
    terms  of  who  curates  or  maintains  it  and  which  can  be  given  a  name  and  a 
    unique  Resource  Identifier.  A  resource  can  be  of  various  types:  a  data  or 
    metadata collection, a computing or storage element, an application, a data and 
    metadata access service, etc. \cite{gray2007}

%% \section{First Paragraph}
%% And now I begin my first chapter here ...

%% Here is an equation\footnote{the notation is explained in the nomenclature section :-)}:

%% \section{Second Paragraph}
%% and here I write more ...\cite{texbook}

%% \subsection{sub first paragraph}
%% ... and some more ...

%% Now I would like to cite the following: \cite{latex} and \cite{texbook}
%% and \cite{Rud73}.

%% I would also like to include a picture ...

%% \begin{figure}[!htbp]
%%   \begin{center}
%%     \leavevmode
%%     \ifpdf
%%       \includegraphics[height=6in]{aflow}

%% % above code has been macro-fied in Classes/MacroFile.tex file
%% %\InsertFig{\IncludeGraphicsH{aflow}{6in}{92 86 545 742}}{Airfoil Picture}{FigAir}

%% So as we have now labelled it we can reference it, like so (\ref{FigAir}) and it
%% is on Page \pageref{FigAir}. And as we can see, it is a very nice picture and we
%% can talk about it all we want and when we are tired we can move on to the next
%% chapter ...

I would also like to add an extra bookmark in acroread like so ...
