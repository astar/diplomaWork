\chapter{ Virtual Observatory (VO)}

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
What is the motivation behind Virtual Observatory? Is data avalanche
problem only in astronomy? What is IVOA?  What is Virtual Observatory
architecture, standards and protocols
\end{lstlisting}

\section{ Data avalanche: Opportunity or disaster?}

There are two important trends in current astronomy surveys:

\begin{itemize}

  \item{Size:} The cumulative compressed data holdings of the ESO archive will
    reach 1 PetaByte by 2012 \cite{hanisch2010international}. Projects
    like Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will produce about 30
    TB per night, leading to a total database over the ten years of
    operations of 60 PB for the raw data.
   
  \item{Complexity:}  Modern surveys will cover the sky in different wave-bands, from
    gamma- and X-rays, optical, infrared, through to radio. The ability
    to cross correlate these observations together may lead to the new
    understanding of physical phenomenas.
\end{itemize}

    Such amount of data is not possible transfer over the network. It
    imply they are heterogeneous, distributed and decentralized in nature.


    There is an interesting analogy with the problem (and the
    solution) which had scientist during LEP project at CERN.  Their
    problem was too many documents in different formats. Tim
    Berners-Lee \footnote{ Sir Timothy John "Tim" Berners-Lee. British
      engineer and computer scientist and MIT professor credited with
      inventing the World Wide Web.} designed set of protocols (URIs,
    HTTP and HTML) which allowed link and share documents
    \cite{berners1990worldwideweb}. This was recognized as generally
    useful and World Wide Web was born. An important role plays the
    World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in developing Web
    standards. \footnote{Prior to its creation, incompatible versions
      of HTML were offered by different vendors, increasing the
      potential for inconsistency between web pages.}

    What is necessary is sets of standards and protocols to deal with
    heterogeneous distributed data and the authority which encourages
    their implementation. Such authority is the International Virtual
    Observatory Alliance (IVOA). It comprises 19 VO programs from
    Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe,
    France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, the
    United Kingdom, and the United States and inter-governmental
    organizations (ESA and ESO)\cite{hanisch2010international}.
   
    Standards specifications can be obtained on \url{http://www.ivoa.net/}.

\section{Architecture}
    The Virtual Observatory is the  “middle layer” framework
    which connects the Resource Layer to the User Layer in a seamless
    and transparent manner. The objective is to improve and unify access to
    astronomical data and services.

    \begin{figure}[!htbp]
      \begin{center}
        \leavevmode
        \ifpdf
        \includegraphics[scale =.6]{architecture}
        \else
        \includegraphics[bb = 92 86 545 742, height=6in]{architecture}
        \fi
        \caption{VO Architecture}
        \label{FigArchitecture}
      \end{center}
    \end{figure}

\clearpage

The Architecture is depicted on the figure \ref{FigArchitecture}.The
level of abstraction goes from top to bottom. Starting with interfaces,
used by people or application to discover resources.  Next level is
the service layer implemented by standard protocols, followed by the
hardware level where actual data are stored. This onion like structure
hide the complexity of the lower layer and provide data and meta-data
to the higher layer. This concept is similar to TCP/IP
\footnote{TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).
  The basic communication language or protocol of the Internet.}
protocol.


The essence of VO architecture is service orientation. Each service is
autonomous with well defined defined boundaries. Very important aspect
of VO implementation is the adoption of formats and protocols used in
astronomy (FITS) and computers science (XML \footnote{Extensible
  Markup Language (XML) is a set of rules for encoding documents in
  machine-readable form.} , Web service \footnote{method of
  communication between two electronic devices over a network.} SOAP
\footnote{Simple Object Access Protocol, is a protocol specification
  for exchanging structured information in the implementation of Web
  Services in computer networks.}) for many years. In other words VO
does not reinvent the wheel but it's stands on the shoulders of
giants.


\section{VOResources}

A resource is a general term referring to a VO element that can be
described in terms of who curates or maintains it and which can be
given a name and a unique identifier. Just about anything can be a
resource: it can be an abstract idea, such as sky coverage or an
instrumental setup, or it can be fairly concrete, like an organization
or a data collection. \cite{bensonivoa}


UML \footnote{Unified Modeling Language. Standardized general-purpose
  modeling language in the field of object-oriented software
  engineering.}  diagram of the resource in on the figure
\ref{FigResource}. Resource can be a generalization of organization,
data collection, application or service. Organization can be linked
together with other organization. The same is true for data
collection. Organization ia a generalization of and/or provider which
can own zero to N services. Publisher can have zero to N resources.

\section{Data Access Protocols}
\subsection{Cone Search Protocol}
\subsection{Simple Image Access Protocol}
\subsection{Simple Spectra Access Protocol}
\section{Data Formats}
\subsection{VOTable}
\subsection{FITS}
\subsubsection*{Motivation}

"An archival format must be utterly portable and self-describing, on
the assumption that, apart from the transcription device, neither the
software nor the hardware that wrote the data will be available when
the data are read." \cite{nrc1995}


\bigskip

FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) was originally created for
exchange of radio astronomy images between WSRT \footnote{Westerbork
  Synthesis Radio Telescope} and the VLA \footnote{Very Large Array}
\cite{fits1997}. It is now used as a file format to store, transmit,
and manipulate scientific data and it is (thanks to it's revolutionary
design) de facto standard in astronomy.


\subsubsection*{Structure}

One file can contain several HDUs (Header Data Units).The first part
of each HDU is the header, composed of ASCII card images containing
keyword=value statements that describe the size, format, and structure
of the data that follow.

\begin{itemize}
\item Primary header and data unit (HDU).
\item Conforming Extensions (optional).
\item Other special records (optional, restricted).
\end{itemize}


Standards and documents related to FITS are maintained by IAUFWG
\footnote{International Astronomical Union FITS} and aviable at
\url{http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov}.

\subsubsection{Examples}

There are many libraries for working with FITS files. The official
list is aviable at
\url{http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_libraries.html}. PyFITS, library
for Python programming language was used for following
examples. PyFITS is a development project of the Science Software
Branch at the Space Telescope Science Institute
\url{http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits}.
