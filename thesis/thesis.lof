The lists of confirmed Be stars consisted of Hipparcos IDs, this was correlated with Hipparcos catalog to obtain right ascension and declination of the objects and subsequently cross-matched with 2MASS catalog to get photometric data. The second set of B stars were acquired in similar manner but using SQL the condition was set to get B type stars different from the list of Be stars.\relax }}{23}{figure.caption.22}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.7}{\ignorespaces Schematic diagram of the spectral Data Mining process. Using SSA protocol the spectra from Ondřejov server was acquired based on the list from photometric study. SSH Tunneling was necessary since Ondřejov spectra are top secret and therefore not available to the public. Convolution had to be performed to ensure compatibility with SDSS. Afterwards desired features were extracted automatically from the spectra after the continuum and H$\alpha $ line were fitted by appropriate functions. The same was done for spectra from SDSS except the convolution process.\relax }}{27}{figure.caption.25}
